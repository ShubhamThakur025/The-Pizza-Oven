Welcome to "The Pizza Oven" digital pizzeria experience! We're thrilled to introduce our pizzeria website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our design ethos revolves around subtlety and modern aesthetics.

### About
The home page consists of our logo, the pizzeria name and a navbar. The navbar has 4 options: Home, about us, reservations and your account. Each option has its own dedicated page. The top right of the page displays a search button to search the contents of our delectable menu, and at the bottom right is the cart button which shows the number of items in the cart. On clicking the cart button, you are directed to the cart which showcases the bill.

Our menu page presents a selection of 15 pizzas, utilizing CSS Flexbox for a structured layout. JavaScript enhances functionality by dynamically replacing the "Add to Cart" button with plus and minus buttons upon clicking. This allows for precise item quantity adjustments, ensuring a seamless user experience.

The cart page provides a comprehensive overview of selected pizzas, displaying item details and quantities. It calculates and presents the total order amount. Upon clicking "Confirm Order," users are seamlessly redirected to the order confirmation page, ensuring a seamless and efficient transaction process.
